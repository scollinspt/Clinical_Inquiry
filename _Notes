# Notes and things to work on

## 2.1.1 Inline formatting

text italic by surrounding it with underscores or asterisks, e.g., _text_ or *text*. 

bold text, use two underscores (__text__) or asterisks (**text**). 

Text surrounded by ~ will be converted to a subscript (e.g., H~2~SO~4~ renders H2SO4)

two carets (^) produce a superscript (e.g., Fe^2+^ renders Fe2+)

To mark text as inline code, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `code`.

Small caps can be produced by the HTML tag span, e.g., <span style=“font-variant:small-caps;”>Small Caps</span> renders Small Caps. 

Links are created using [text](link), e.g., [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), 

syntax for images is similar: just add an exclamation mark, e.g., ![alt text or image title](path/to/image). 

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[], e.g., ^[This is a footnote.]. 

Blockquotes are written after >, e.g.,

> “I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him.”
>
> — Mark Twain

2.1.3 Math expressions

Inline LaTeX equations can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$ (actual output:  

math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., $$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$

2.2.1 Number and reference equations

To number and refer to equations, put them in the equation environments and assign labels to them using the syntax (\#eq:label), e.g.,

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}
