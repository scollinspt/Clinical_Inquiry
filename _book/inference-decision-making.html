<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Inference &amp; Decision Making</h1>
<p>Inference is something inferred or the act of inferring. To infer is to draw a conclusion from a set of facts or premises. Inference is a way of knowing. Our critical realist epistemological axioms provide some starting assumptions and conditions about knowing. Inference provides a way to know. Since reasoning in clinical practice is based on knowing (conclusions drawn from a sets of facts or premises) then clinical reasoning includes the process of making inferences (inferring).</p>
<p>Clinical reasoning includes making inferences and the process is ongoing across time. So clinical reasoning is dynamic inference with decision making. Even the process to decide what fact to collect during an examination is a decision based on a prior inference. Already known facts and prior inferences combine with new facts to generate new inferences which leads to new decisions, and so on. Clinical reasoning is a stream of dynamic inferences that enable clinical decision making which when combined with carrying out the decisions is clinical practice. Clinical practice is combining decisions with carrying out those decisions; and the decisions are made through the dynamic inferences during clinical reasoning.</p>
<p>Dynamic inferences are dynamic in both time and type (temporally and spatially). To understand these dynamic inferences we start with the three foundational types of inference that are dynamically combined during clinical reasoning.</p>
<pre><code>1.  Deductive inference
2.  Inductive inference
3.  Abductive inference </code></pre>
<div id="dynamic-inference" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Dynamic Inference</h2>
<p>We started this chapter by relating dynamic inference and clinical reasoning. Clinical reasoning is making inferences iteratively in time therefore it is dynamic in time. Clinical inferences are abductive, deductive and inductive and therefore they are dynamic in type. Clinical reasoning is a stream of dynamic inferences that enable clinical decision making. Clinical practice combines decisions with carrying out those decisions. To understand clinical reasoning as dynamic inference the chapter introduced readers to the three foundational types of inference that are combined during clinical reasoning. The reader is now prepared for a deeper consideration of deduction by considering logical theorems in Chapter 4.</p>
</div>
<div id="deductive-inference" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Deductive Inference</h2>
<p>Deductive inference (deduction) is the process of moving from (possibly provisional) acceptance of a set of propositions to a conclusion (which is also a proposition). It is a form of inference you have learned about if you have ever taken an Introduction to Logic course. It is the form of inference covered in Aristotle’s syllogisms (which are all valid forms of deductive inference). Deduction has two characteristics that make it unique from among the three types of inference. First, there are valid forms of deductive inference (Chapter 2) where the form is true in all states as well as satisfiable forms where the conclusion is true given a particular set of states of the propositions.[1] Note that this first characteristic is what truly sets deduction apart from induction and abduction. Second, deductive inference can include a set of universal and specific propositions to generate a universal or specific propositions. Though it is most commonly noted to move from universal and specific propositions to specific conclusion. This second characteristic does not set deduction apart, but when combined with the first characteristic it becomes very powerful in clinical reasoning. The ability to move from universal and specific propositions to specific propositions (or some might say from general to specific, or universals to particulars) is what we do in clinical reasoning when making a treatment decision for a particular patient. Essentially, this is the answer to the question asked by my epidemiology professor in 1997: “How do you apply sample statistics from a study to a patient?” The simple answer is: deduction. He was actually asking the question rhetorically, not expecting an answer.
In Chapter 2 the reader was introduced to a valid form of deductive inference with Modus Ponens (3.77):
(3.77) Modus Ponens:<br />
Further discussion of (3.77) and other valid and satisfiable expressions of deductive inference are introduced in Chapter 4 utilizing notation from propositional logic.[2]<br />
Examples
With these examples the reader should simply become comfortable with the various ways deductive inference is used generally and in practice.</p>
<p>Example 1
A valid form of deduction with two specific propositions, followed by a specific conclusion:
Bob is taller than John (premise 1)
John is taller than Mike (premise 2)
Therefore Bob is taller than Mike (conclusion)
This example emphasizes the feature of specific propositions to a specific conclusion.</p>
<p>Example 2
A valid form of deduction with a universal and specific proposition, followed by a specific conclusion:
All DPT students are intelligent (premise 1)
Kate is a DPT student (premise 2)
Therefore that Kate is intelligent (conclusion)
This example emphasizes the feature of flowing from universal and specific propositions to a specific conclusion.</p>
<p>Example 3
With valid expressions of deduction, the only way for a conclusion to be false () is for one of the premises to be found untrue.
All swans are white (premise 1)
There is a swan in the other room (premise 2)
Therefore that swan must be white (conclusion)
Here we have a conclusion that might be true or false. But the form of the argument is valid. Despite the validity of the form we know that premise one is false. It could be a black swan. Since premise 1 is false then the conclusion might be false. This example emphasizes the point that all valid expressions of deduction are satisfiable.</p>
<p>Example 4
The use of deductive inference in practice may include the full argument and the desire to achieve the conclusion through manipulation of premises (note that premise two is an intervention).
Respiratory muscle training strengthens respiratory muscles.
Patient does respiratory muscle training.
Therefore the patient strengthens respiratory muscles.
This is a simplification of the thought process going on at the time. But it allows us to notice that with deduction in practice we are usually thinking of the conclusion we want and manipulating one premise. Here we accept the first premise, we want the conclusion to be true, so we intervene with the second premise. That is how most interventions are determined – some premises are accepted, a conclusion is desired, the premises that are needed to get from the existing premises to the desired conclusion are acted on (intervention). As above we have a conclusion that might be true or false. But the form of the argument is valid so that if the premises are true then the conclusion will be true. This example emphasizes prior points from the examples above (universal and specific premises to specific conclusions; and all valid expressions are satisfiable) and introduces a typical pattern of using deduction in practice.</p>
<p>Example 5
In this example we expand on the above example and sneak in an assumption (unstated premise).
Premises:
Respiratory muscle training strengthens respiratory muscles.
Weak respiratory muscles cause dyspnea on exertion (DOE).
This patient has weak respiratory muscles.
This patient has DOE.
Patient does respiratory muscle training. (Intervention)
Desired conclusions:
This patient no longer has weak respiratory muscles.
This patient no longer has DOE.
We know that not every patient with weak respiratory muscles and DOE that participates in respiratory muscle training has a complete amelioration of DOE. So there are issues. But why does reality not match our conclusion all the time? Is it that this is not a logical form? Or it is that one of the universal premises is not always true and therefore we observe situations where one of the premises is false? Or did we sneak in an assumption? While weak respiratory muscles can cause DOE; there are other causes of dyspnea on exertion. So it is possible for the first conclusion to be true, but the second conclusion to be false. It turns out we have snuck in an assumption (unstated premise) that is actually a fallacy. We have an assumption that equates:
Weak respiratory muscles cause DOE, with
No Weak respiratory muscles cause No DOE
But these are not equivalent (as you will learn in Chapter 4). So we have actually changed the premise when we made our conclusion. We switched from Weakness causes DOE to No Weakness causes no DOE and that is an error. However, not being equivalent does not mean it is automatically untrue. Just that the truth of is not determined (assured) by the truth of the original implication. This example emphasizes different ways deduction can go wrong.
Summary
Hopefully the reader has an understanding and some insights into the use of deduction in clinical reasoning and the possible use of logic to identify errors in clinical reasoning. Systematically breaking down clinical reasoning to identify the logical expressions improves practice and improves research by highlighting what we know and what need to know. Thinking systematically helps us recognize the flaws (formal or informal) in our reasoning. There is a problem being identified with the proliferation of articles on the lack of adoption of “evidence based practice” by clinicians and the lack of incorporation of clinical practice guidelines. Clinical Inquiry offers a solution, but it is not being developed as a solution. It is being developed as a better system of thought, better as in a stronger foundation (critical realism over empiricism), and more encompassing of the full spectrum of clinical reasoning (dynamic inference, with deduction as a clear and previously under emphasized component).[3]</p>
<p>[1] There are forms categorized as logical fallacies (formal fallacies). With a formal fallacy the premises do not entail (require) the conclusion.
[2] The truth of inductively determined premises such as p implies q is probable. In Part II on applications we incorporate the probabilistic logic of Adams, Ernest W. “A primer of probability logic.” (1996) as an important part of dynamic inference.
[3] By under emphasized the author means that deduction, while always included in books on clinical reasoning and evidence based practice, is not covered based on its logical foundations. At the same time logic is not a commonly required pre-requisite course for physical therapy programs.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Inductive Inference</h2>
<p>Inductive inference (induction) is the process of moving from acceptance of a set of premises to a conclusion while allowing for the possibility that the conclusion is false despite all of the premises being true. It is a form of inference you have learned about if you have ever taken a statistics (statistical inference) or research methods course. Induction is unique from deduction because there are no valid expressions of inductive inference where the expression is true in all states.[1] The common utilization of inductive inference generally proceeds from a set of specific propositions to generate a universal proposition (or a set of specific facts to generate a universal claim about those facts). This is also contrary to the most commonly noted use of deductive inference (which tends to be utilized to proceed from universal and specific propositions to specific conclusion). The ability to move from specific to universal (from particulars to universals) is what we do in research when setting up opportunities to structure our observations (particulars) in an effort to conclude something about reality (universals). Inductive inferences generate the universal premises to be utilized in clinical reasoning when making a treatment decision for a particular patient that actually utilizes deduction. To return to my epidemiology professor in 1997: “How do you apply sample statistics from a study to a patient?” The expanded answer is: your sample statistics inductively generate universals from which we can deduce particulars.
Inductive inference can be structured which we will refer to as formal (research based observations and a hierarchy that reflects our belief in the likelihood of true inductive inferences (that is true universals). It can also unstructured which we will refer to as informal (experience observing your surroundings and learning from it). In both formal and informal inductive inferences there are assumptions, methodological considerations that influence the observations, statistical assumptions, influences of prior knowledge, and different levels of consistency of observations. Inductive inference enables a framework for a Clinical Inquiry to compare and contrast the pros and cons of research studies and their derivatives such as systematic reviews with other types of observation such as a clinician’s experience and case studies or series.
In Chapter 2 the reader was introduced to a form of inductive inference with a quantification (2.1) that is a constant conjunction of events (observable events):
(2.1) Quantification:
Further discussion of (2.1) and other expressions of inductive inference are introduced in Chapter 5 utilizing axioms and notation from Probability.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Examples</h3>
<p>With these examples the reader should simply become comfortable with the various ways inductive inference is used generally and in practice.</p>
<div id="example-1" class="section level4" number="2.3.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.1</span> Example 1</h4>
<p>A inductive inference with two specific propositions, followed by a universal conclusion:
A study samples 10 swans from a pond in Massachusetts
All the swans were white
Therefore, all swans are white.
As an inductive inference we leave open the possibility that this conclusion is wrong despite knowing that the premises are true. The presence of one white swan refutes the conclusion.
This example emphasizes the feature of specific propositions based on observation to a universal conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2" class="section level4" number="2.3.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.2</span> Example 2</h4>
<p>A inductive inference with two specific propositions, followed by a universal conclusion:
A study samples 1000 swans from North America
All the swans were white
Therefore, all swans are white.
As an inductive inference we leave open the possibility that this conclusion is wrong despite knowing that the premises are true but we are more likely to believe this conclusion because of the larger and more representative sample. This example emphasizes that the number of observations and from where they are sampled changes our believe in the conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-3" class="section level4" number="2.3.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.3</span> Example 3</h4>
<p>An inference with two specific propositions, followed by a specific conclusion:
A study samples 10 swans from a pond in Massachusetts
All the swans were white
Therefore, these 10 swans are white.
This is actually a deductive inference snuck in to prove a point. Here we do not leave open the possibility that this conclusion is wrong despite knowing that the premises are true. If the premises are true then the conclusion is true. The conclusion’s scope is so limited the only way it would be wrong is if the 10 swans were not all white. The only way this is wrong is if there is a problem with measurement of swan color (basic reliability of sensory perception).
This example emphasizes the feature of specific propositions based on observation to a specific conclusions of having limited contribution outside of the particular scope.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.4</span> Example 4</h4>
<p>A inductive inference with two specific propositions, followed by a universal conclusion:
A study randomly samples swans across the Northern Hemisphere
swans were white, swans were black
Therefore, 10% of swans are black
As an inductive inference we leave open the possibility that this conclusion is wrong despite knowing that the premises are true but we are more likely to believe this conclusion because of the larger and more representative sample. Using statistical inference (covered in Part II after having a foundation in Probability in Chapter 5) we can determine the probability of future samples of swans also having 10% of them being black as a confidence interval. The size of the confidence interval is related to how many swans are sampled. And the universality of this conclusion is also related to where it was sampled. For example, there may be reasons for a different color pattern in the Southern Hemisphere. This example emphasizes that the number of observations and from where they are sampled changes our believe in the conclusion.</p>
<p>It may happen because of randomness, that is one category of error leading to inductive problems. Essentially, the methods of observation, and analysis should be attempts to minimize the inductive problem. Whenever reading a paper we can considering it’s “external validity” (also called generalizability) by considering the likelihood that the study has an induction problem (will be refuted in some case).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Summary</h3>
<p>Hopefully the reader has an understanding and some insights into the use of induction in clinical reasoning. There is value in defining induction based on its differences with deduction. Furthermore there is value in defining both research (including its derivatives) and clinical experience based on their foundations in inductive inference. By having a common framework such as inductive inference we can compare and contrast the universals generated through these different approaches to learning. Finally, there is value in students and professionals looking to advance practice to consider the inductive inferences utilized to generate the universals they utilizing alongside the deductive inferences they are using to generate particulars in practice. The dynamic inference of Clinical Inquiry relies on the interplay between inductively generated universal conclusions and deductively generated particular conclusions.</p>
<p>[1] There can be valid expressions about induction that are actually deductive inferences.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Abductive Inference</h2>
<p>Abductive inference (abduction) adopts characteristics from both deduction and induction. The characteristic from deduction is that abduction tends to progress from a acceptance of a set of universal and particular premises to a particular conclusion. A characteristic from induction is that abduction allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false despite all of the premises being true. It is a form of inference you may never have heard about before by name. However, if you have ever inferred the possible reasons for a current situation you have used abductive inference. For example, if you have ever inferred that it rained over night based on seeing everything wet and puddles outside in the morning then you have used abductive inference. When Sherlock Holmes says to Watson, “It’s deduction my dear Watson” he really should have been saying “It’s abduction my dear Watson.” It is just that the terminology and distinguishing features of abduction had not been utilized yet when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was writing.
If you have taken a logic course you may have learned about abduction as a formal fallacy called affirming the consequent. Since you know about Modus Ponens affirming the consequent is easy to understand:</p>
<p>(3.77) Modus Ponens:<br />
Affirming the consequent:</p>
<p>As you can see, Affirming the consequent says that if p implies q, and you have q then it implies p. However, this is not the case all the time and therefore this is not valid (not true in all states). We will leave it to the reader - as an Exercise - to determine whether Affirming the consequent is satisfiable.
Abduction was introduced in the writings C.S. Peirce around the beginning of the 20th century.[1] He was interested in how scientists (he was a geologist prior to becoming a logician and philosopher) came up with hypotheses to test experimentally. He recognized that hypotheses are generated by trying to figure out what is behind (underlying, causing…) our observations. This type of thinking is so pervasive in our every day and professional lives it remains a challenge[2] to recognize when it is being done and to consider the implications of the differences between deduction and induction. Sherlock Holmes was most likely too correct too often given the fallacy underlying his deductions and as we will learn later given the influence that probability has on abduction (as it does on induction).
Abduction is a critical part of clinical reasoning for practice. Patient’s seek physical therapy because they have a problem. The solution to a problem cannot begin unless the problem is understood. Understanding the problem requires abduction. But abduction has limitations, and therefore understanding the problems has limitations. To improve practice we must understand how to utilize abduction with due consideration its limitations.</p>

<div id="example-1-1" class="section level4" number="2.4.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.1</span> Example 1</h4>
<p>An abductive inference with a universal and specific proposition, followed by a specific conclusion:
Heart failure (HF) leads to dyspnea on exertion (DOE)
A person has DOE
Therefore, the person has HF
As an abductive inference we leave open the possibility that this conclusion is wrong despite knowing that the premises are true. The presence of DOE does not mean, conclusively, that the person has HF. There are other possible explanations.
This example emphasizes the most important feature abduction that we don’t actually know whether the person has HF or not, but it raises the question of whether they have HF and therefore warrants investigation. As Peirce had intended, it raises the hypothesis that needs to be tested. This example also emphasizes what you need to know from physiology and pathophysiology, that is, that HF leads to DOE, and also what else leads to DOE?</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Summary</h3>
<p>Hopefully the reader has an understanding and some insights into the use of abduction in clinical reasoning. There is value in defining abduction based on its differences and similarities with deduction and induction. A key reason to understand abduction is to understand its limitations as the examples above emphasize and due to the importance of its use in clinical reasoning.
Abductive inference has been intentionally presented and examples have emphasized its most general form. When we learn about probability in Chapter 5 we connect abduction to Bayes theorem and consider as Bayes inference as a special form of abduction. Then in Part II on applications we use Bayes inference to understand tests of diagnostic accuracy that you may be familiar with such as sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios. Combined with our causal models from Chapter 7 we then consider clinical reasoning when making a differential diagnosis which combines the hypothesis generating property of abduction with the diagnostic accuracy considerations of Bayes inference. Having both the general form of abduction and understanding its connection with Bayes theorem, Bayes inference and differential diagnosis allows Clinical Inquiry to offer a robust approach to considering what must be known and how to organize that knowledge for the abductive component of dynamic inference.</p>
